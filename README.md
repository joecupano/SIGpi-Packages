# SIGpi-Packages
Can't find recent versions of your favorite RF_related software available as ARM64 or AMD64 Debian packages such as SDRangel ?
Well for the [SIGpi](https://github.com/joecupano/SIGpi/wiki)  distro we decided to build our own from sourc with an aim to
be on top of X.Y releases. 

In this repo you will Debian packages (arm64 and amd64) for:

- SDRangel 7.8.5, 7.8.6, and 7.9.0
- SDRangel Server 7.9.0
- SDRpp 1.1.0
- WSJT-X 2.6.0

More may be added over time. Know these packages are optimized for SIGpi but should have little if any issue on other Debian based
distros for Raspberry Pi and Ubuntu 22.04

Cheers,

Joe
